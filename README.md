# rm-brain

A local-first "second brain" for your handwritten **reMarkable** notebooks. It quietly
syncs the notebooks you tag `#brain`, transcribes and classifies the handwriting with
the Claude API, and stores everything in a local SQLite database. You then **search and
explore it as an ordinary conversation in Claude Desktop** — no separate app, no hosted
service, using your existing Claude subscription.

> Ask *"what did I decide about Acme pricing?"* or *"what open loops have I been ignoring?"*
> and Claude answers with receipts: notebook name, page number, date, and the scanned page.

## How it works

```
reMarkable Cloud
   │  rmapi (list + tags + export annotated PDF)
   ▼
Annotated PDF  ──pdftoppm──►  page PNGs  ──►  Extraction (Claude vision, 1 call/page)
                                                     │
                                                     ▼
                                        SQLite + FTS5   ◄──►  MCP server  ◄──►  Claude Desktop
```

## What data goes where

Everything lives in **one portable folder**, `RM_BRAIN_HOME` (default `~/.rm-brain`):

- `db.sqlite` — notebooks, pages, transcribed text (FTS5 index), entities
- `images/` — one PNG per page, for citations
- `manifest.json` — content hashes so only new/changed pages get reprocessed

**The only things that ever leave your machine** are (a) individual page images sent to
the Claude API during `sync`, and (b) individual queries + retrieved snippets sent through
MCP while you search in Claude Desktop. The database, images, and manifest never leave as
a whole.

### Portability & backup

Because the whole index is that one self-contained folder:

- **Back up:** `rm-brain backup [dest.tar.gz]` writes a clean, portable snapshot. Or just
  copy `~/.rm-brain`.
- **Restore / move machines:** extract the archive anywhere and point `RM_BRAIN_HOME` at it.
- **Auto-backup / roam:** set `RM_BRAIN_HOME` to a Dropbox/iCloud/Syncthing folder and it
  backs itself up continuously.
- `rm-brain info` shows exactly where the data lives and how big it is.

## Privacy model — opt-in

- **Nothing is indexed unless you tag it `#brain`** on the tablet. The safe default is
  "do nothing"; sending a notebook to Claude requires a deliberate act.
- **Hard exclusion always wins:** a notebook whose name matches `/^\./`, `/private/i`, or
  `/noindex/i` is skipped entirely — never exported, extracted, or sent anywhere — even if
  it also carries `#brain`.
- `rm-brain exclude "<name>"` excludes a notebook after the fact **and purges** its already
  indexed pages and images.
- `rm-brain purge` deletes the entire local index.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **poppler** (`pdftoppm`): `brew install poppler`
- **rmapi** — the reMarkable Cloud CLI. Install it and pair it once (it prompts for a
  one-time code): <https://github.com/juruen/rmapi>
- **Anthropic API key** — used only during `sync` for handwriting extraction.

## Install

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm link   # optional: puts `rm-brain` on your PATH
```

## Setup

```bash
rm-brain setup     # checks deps and prints your Claude Desktop config block
rm-brain doctor    # verify rmapi, poppler, API key, data home
```

`setup` prints a block like this — paste it into Claude Desktop's config file
(`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS), then restart
Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rm-brain": { "command": "rm-brain", "args": ["mcp"], "env": { "RM_BRAIN_HOME": "/Users/you/.rm-brain" } }
  }
}
```

## Usage

1. On the tablet, tag a notebook `#brain` (and let it sync to the reMarkable cloud).
2. Index it:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   rm-brain sync
   ```
3. Ask Claude Desktop about your notes in plain language.

### CLI reference

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `rm-brain setup` | Interactive setup wizard; prints the Claude Desktop config |
| `rm-brain sync` | Pull `#brain` notebooks, render, extract, index |
| `rm-brain search "<query>"` | Full-text search from the terminal |
| `rm-brain list` | Show indexed notebooks and page counts |
| `rm-brain info` | Where the data lives + stats |
| `rm-brain backup [dest]` | Write a portable `.tar.gz` of the whole index |
| `rm-brain exclude "<name>"` / `include "<name>"` | Exclude (purges) / re-include a notebook |
| `rm-brain purge` | Delete the entire local index |
| `rm-brain doctor` | Check dependencies |
| `rm-brain mcp` | Start the MCP server (Claude Desktop runs this) |

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RM_BRAIN_HOME` | `~/.rm-brain` | Where all local data lives |
| `RMAPI_BIN` | `rmapi` | Path/name of the rmapi binary |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Required only for `sync` (extraction) |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` | Vision model for extraction |

## Cost

`sync` makes **one** Claude vision call per new or changed page (change detection means
unchanged pages are never reprocessed). Pick a cheaper or stronger model via
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`.

## A note on tags

Tag support depends on your installed `rmapi` surfacing document tags. If it can't, tagged
documents look untagged and are simply skipped (fail-safe — nothing is sent). In that case,
put `#brain` in the notebook's **name** instead, or upgrade rmapi.

## Not in v1 (on purpose)

No vector search / embeddings (FTS5 keyword search only), no notifications or daily digests,
no summary dashboard, no web UI. This stays a tool you reach for, not one that reaches for you.
